Lab 20: Back-end Deployment 

**Author:** Jennifer Piper


## Getting Started
In a node.js environment, from the root of this repo, install dependencies:
* `npm i`

Start the database server: 
* `npm run dbon`

Run tests (this starts the Node server before the tests, and stops it after the tests):
* `npm run test`

To turn off the database server: 
* `npm run dboff`
